During the summer of 2021, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with [Kyaro Assistive Tech](http://kyaroassistive.org) while living in Arusha, Tanzania. Kyaro works to design and locally produce affordable, high-quality assistive devices such as wheelchairs and walkers for the underserved markets of East Africa.

Thanks to the folks behind the [Olin Public Interest Technology Summer Fellowship](http://pint.olin.edu/fellowship/) for making this possible!

My summer included lots of sketching, prototyping, and mechanical design work in CAD. We also interacted with current and prospective users of Kyaro devices to better understand their needs, goals, and desires. Here, in a village in the Kilimanjaro foothills, I'm examining the brakes of an amputee's current wheelchair to find failure modes and inform our own brake designs.

I also worked with Kyaro's lead fabricator (or "fundi" in Swahili), Nelson, to make improvements to the fabrication process. When the goal is to offer affordable, high-quality medical devices to people who couldn't otherwise afford them, every inefficiency counts! As Kyaro seeks to expand its production capacity, we also spent time considering how we can involve more fabricators without making any compromises on device quality.
