During the summer of 2021, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with ![Kyaro Assistive Tech](http://kyaroassistive.org) while living in Arusha, Tanzania. Kyaro works to design and locally produce affordable, high-quality assistive devices such as wheelchairs and walkers for the underserved markets of East Africa.
