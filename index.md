## Hi! Nice to meet you.

I'm Luke Raus, a third-year robotics student at Olin College of Engineering.
My passions lie at the intersection of mathematics, robotics, and education; I'm particularly interested in modern formulations of state estimation & motion planning problems and recent research into how engineers and physicists represent geometric entities, such as through the tools of geometric algebra.
